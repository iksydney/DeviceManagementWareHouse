Device management system to keep track of all devices in a warehouse.
This is to keep a log of all devices in my store to help generate reports of these devices, their names, status, temperature and categories.
Devices have temperatures and ability to generate a report on temperature should be considered.
Devices also have categories of both mobile devices or computers.
An operator should be able to look up if a device is functional/faulty/in repair mode and how often a device develops faults.
